# Introduction

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of many disciplines, including
business, science, academia, journalism, and others. Good visualization
allows users to explore data inactively and understand relationships
between variables. In this report, we will go through the process of
producing visualizations for a scientific research project.

## What is Scientific Research

Scientific research is a systematic process aimed at generating new
knowledge, understanding phenomena, or solving problems through
experimentation, observation, analysis, and interpretation. Part of the
process involves collecting and processing data processing for
visualization. Specifically interpreting data relies on effective
visualization to confirm or deny the hypothesis.

## A real world case study

- the purpose of the study was to determine if the combination of
  Bacillus cereus and Pseudomonas alcaligenes, as a bio-priming agent,
  yielded an overall healthier plant at the end of germination stage

# Research Question

- How do we take real-world data for a real scientific study, process
  the data, and visualize it?

## Why do we do this (Rationale)

- We need to display the relationship between bio-priming seeds and the
  overall health of the plant at germination
- visualizing the data helps us visibly compare root length averages and
  growth overtime compared to the control non-exposed plants

## How do we do this?

- we do this by looking at root and sprout growth (length, size,
  coloration)
- to determine if there are differing affects on monocot and dicot
  plants

# Definitions

Bio-priming  
The process of coating the seed with a plant-growth promoting bacteria
consortium

Monocot plant  
The seeds of these plants typically contain a single embryonic leaf

Dicot plant  
A plant whose germinating seed contain two embryonic leaves

Embryonic leaf  
The plant embryo, also known as cotyledon
