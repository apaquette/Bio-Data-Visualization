# Introduction

Data visualization is a fundamental tool across a multitude of disciplines, serving as a conduit for conveying complex information in a visually accessible manner. In scientific research, where the exploration and interpretation of data are paramount, effective visualization techniques play a pivotal role in illuminating patterns, trends, and relationships within datasets. By transforming raw data into intuitive visual representations, researchers can gain deeper insights into their findings and communicate them with clarity and precision. In this report, we embark on a journey through the process of producing visualizations for scientific research, unraveling the methodologies and strategies that underpin the creation of impactful visual narratives.

## Understanding Scientific Research

Scientific research constitutes a meticulous and systematic pursuit of knowledge, aiming to illuminate phenomena, develop theories, or solve practical problems through rigorous methodologies such as experimentation, observation, analysis, and interpretation. Central to this endeavor is the collection and processing of data, which serves as the cornerstone for empirical investigation. However, the mere accumulation of data is insufficient without effective interpretation and communication. Data visualization emerges as a vital tool in this process, enabling researchers to distill complex datasets into intuitive visual representations that facilitate hypothesis confirmation or refutation. By harnessing the power of visualization, researchers can discern patterns, trends, and relationships within data, thereby advancing our understanding of the natural world and informing evidence-based decision-making.

## A Real-world Case Study

The real-world case study at the heart of our visualization endeavor revolves around an investigation into the potential benefits of utilizing a bio-priming agent comprising *Bacillus cereus* and *Pseudomonas alcaligenes* during the germination stage of plant development. The overarching objective of this study is to assess whether the application of this bio-priming agent contributes to the overall health and vigor of plants upon completion of the germination process.

The study aims to demonstrate the efficacy of the bio-priming agent in enhancing plant growth, resilience, and productivity by leveraging the natural symbiotic relationship between *Bacillus cereus* and *Pseudomonas alcaligenes*. Through a series of controlled experiments and rigorous data collection protocols, researchers seek to evaluate various physiological parameters, including seed germination rates, seedling vigor, root development, and resistance to environmental stressors.

By employing a multidisciplinary approach that integrates microbiology, plant biology, and agronomy, the study endeavors to shed light on the potential applications of bio-priming techniques in sustainable agriculture practices. The findings from this research hold promise for informing agricultural strategies aimed at optimizing plant health and productivity while minimizing reliance on synthetic inputs and agrochemicals.

This real-world case study serves as the foundation for our exploration of data visualization techniques, providing a concrete context for the application of visual analytics in scientific research and innovation within the agricultural domain.

# Research Question

-   How do we take real-world data for a real scientific study, process the data, and visualize it?

## Rationale Behind the Study

-   We need to display the relationship between bio-priming seeds and the overall health of the plant at germination
-   visualizing the data helps us visibly compare root length averages and growth overtime compared to the control non-exposed plants

## Methodology

-   we do this by looking at root and sprout growth (length, size, coloration)
-   to determine if there are differing affects on monocot and dicot plants

# Glossary of Terms

## Biology

Bio-priming

:   The process of coating the seed with a plant-growth promoting bacteria consortium

Monocot plant

:   The seeds of these plants typically contain a single embryonic leaf

Dicot plant

:   A plant whose germinating seed contain two embryonic leaves

Embryonic leaf

:   The plant embryo, also known as cotyledon
